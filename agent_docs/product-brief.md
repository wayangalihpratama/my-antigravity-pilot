# Product Brief: My Antigravity Pilot (Skeleton)

## Problem Statement
AI coding assistants like Antigravity are powerful, but their effectiveness is limited by the context and "rules of the road" they are given for a specific tech stack. Setting up these configurations (rules, skills, workflows) manually for every project is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Target Users
- **AI-First Developers**: Developers who use AI agents as primary pair programmers.
- **Team Leads**: Ensuring consistency and best practices across multiple projects and tech stacks.

## Value Proposition
Provides a curated collection of "AI-ready" project skeletons. Each stack comes pre-configured with the **BMAD methodology** and stack-specific best practices, enabling an AI agent to hit the ground running with zero configuration.

## Core Pillars
1. **Multi-Stack Support**: FastAPI, Next.js, Laravel, Streamlit, etc.
2. **BMAD Agent Team**: 8 specialized roles (PM to Writer) integrated into every stack.
3. **Standardized Workflows**: Consistent research-implement-verify-commit cycles.
4. **TDD-First**: Enforced testing standards to ensure AI safety and code quality.

## Project Scope
- Maintenance of stack-specific `.agent` configurations.
- Evolution of the BMAD methodology.
- Tooling for project initialization (`setup.sh`).

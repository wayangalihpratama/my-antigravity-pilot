## Rule Priority (When Rules Conflict)

When two rules pull in opposite directions, use this priority to decide:

1. **Security** — never compromise security for convenience
2. **Consistency** — follow existing patterns in each stack directory
3. **Stack conventions** — respect the target framework's idioms
4. **Simplicity** — when equally valid, prefer the simpler approach

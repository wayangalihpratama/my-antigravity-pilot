## Repository Structure

This is a **multi-stack agent skeleton repository**. Each subdirectory represents a different fullstack tech stack with its own `.agent/` configuration.

### Directory Convention

```
<stack-name>/
└── .agent/
    ├── rules/        # Coding standards (always_on + model_decision)
    ├── skills/       # On-demand task guides (<name>/SKILL.md)
    └── workflows/    # Development phase workflows
```

### Rules for This Repo

1. **Each stack is self-contained** — its `.agent/` must work independently when copied to another project
2. **Use two-tier trigger system** — `always_on` for universal rules, `model_decision` for contextual rules
3. **Skills need frontmatter** — every `SKILL.md` must have `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter
4. **All commands must use Docker** — never reference bare `python`, `node`, `yarn`, etc. without the stack's Docker wrapper
5. **Cross-reference between files** — rules, skills, and workflows should link to related files using `@filename.md`
6. **Adapt, don't copy** — when sourcing from external repos, adapt content for the specific stack (rename commands, adjust paths, localize examples)

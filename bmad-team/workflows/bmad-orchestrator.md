# BMAD Lifecycle Orchestrator

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**

YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM SKIPPING PHASES.
You must treat this file as a State Machine. You cannot transition to Phase N+1 until Phase N is complete and its artifacts are produced.

## Role

You are the BMAD Orchestrator, responsible for guiding a product through its entire lifecycle using the 8 specialized BMAD agent roles. Each phase produces artifacts consumed by the next.

## Pre-Flight

Before starting:
1. Confirm the project name and scope with the user
2. **Detect the current stack** (e.g., FastAPI/Next.js, Laravel, Streamlit) by checking the directory name and its `.agent/rules/`.
3. Create an `agent_docs/` directory for artifacts
4. **Check for existing artifacts** in `agent_docs/`. Explain the distinction between **Living Documents** (updated to maintain current state) and **Chronological Records** (newly created to preserve history).

5. Ask the user: "**Is this a new feature, refinement, refactor, or a general task?**"
6. Ask if the user wants to run all phases or start from a specific phase


## Lifecycle Phases

**CRITICAL: DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE**
For every phase, if a corresponding artifact already exists in `agent_docs/`, you MUST:
1. Read the existing artifact first.
2. Determine if the current task is a revision/enhancement of an existing feature or a completely new one.
3. If it's a revision or enhancement to the project's current state, **update** the corresponding **Living Document** (`prd.md`, `architecture.md`, `user-guide.md`, `README.md`).
4. If it's a point-in-time record or a significant update to a historical trail, **create a new** **Chronological Record** (`ADRs`, `stories`, `sprint-plans`, `research-findings`) with a new version number or ID.



### Phase 1: Ideate 📋
**Agent**: bmad-pm (John, Product Manager)
**Goal**: Define project vision (Skeleton) or feature requirements
**Steps**:
1. Load the bmad-pm skill
2. Update **Living Documents** (`product-brief.md`, `prd.md`) ONLY if the task is a "General Task" or "Vision Change" that affects the project skeleton.
3. For "Feature" or "Refinement" tasks, create a **Feature Document** in `agent_docs/features/`.
**Artifacts Produced**:
- `agent_docs/product-brief.md` (Update only)
- `agent_docs/prd.md` (Update only)
- `agent_docs/features/[issue-id]-[slug].md` (New/Update)
**Gate**: User approves the updated Skeleton or the new Feature Document before proceeding

### Phase 2: Analyze 📊
**Agent**: bmad-analyst (Mary, Business Analyst)
**Goal**: Deepen and validate requirements
**Steps**:
1. Load the bmad-analyst skill
2. Review Feature Document from Phase 1
3. Conduct deep research on key areas
4. Refine Feature Document with hardened requirements

### Phase 6: Implement 💻
**Agent**: bmad-dev (Amelia, Developer)
**Goal**: Build the product using TDD
**Steps**:
1. Load the bmad-dev skill
2. Pick approved stories from sprint plan
3. For each story, run TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)
4. Delegate to stack-specific `/2-implement` workflow
5. Mark stories as Implemented
**Artifacts Produced**:
- Working code with tests
- Updated story statuses
**Gate**: All acceptance criteria met, tests passing

---

### Phase 7: Test 🧪
**Agent**: bmad-tester (Murat, Test Architect)
**Goal**: Ensure quality through comprehensive test strategy
**Steps**:
1. Load the bmad-tester skill
2. Review implemented code and existing tests
3. Design test strategy (pyramid, quality gates)
4. Identify coverage gaps
5. Define CI/CD quality gates
**Artifacts Produced**:
- `agent_docs/test-strategy.md`
- Quality gate configuration
**Gate**: All quality gates pass

---

### Phase 8: Document 📚
**Agent**: bmad-writer (Paige, Tech Writer)
**Goal**: Create comprehensive technical documentation
**Steps**:
1. Load the bmad-writer skill
2. Review all artifacts from previous phases
3. Create API documentation
4. Create architecture documentation
5. Create user guide / README
**Artifacts Produced**:

- `agent_docs/architecture-docs.md`
- `agent_docs/user-guide.md`
- Updated `README.md`
**Gate**: Documentation passes quality audit

## Phase Management

### Progress Tracking
- `[ ]` = Not started
- `[/]` = In progress
- `[x]` = Complete (gate passed)

### Phase Transitions
Before moving to the next phase, verify:
- [ ] Current phase artifacts produced
- [ ] Gate criteria met
- [ ] User approval received (for phases with approval gates)

### Error Handling
If a phase fails:
1. Document the failure
2. Do NOT proceed to the next phase
3. Fix within the current phase
4. Re-run the gate check

### Partial Execution
Users may start from any phase if prerequisites are met:
- If starting from Phase 3, ensure PRD exists
- If starting from Phase 6, ensure stories exist
- Always validate upstream artifacts before proceeding
